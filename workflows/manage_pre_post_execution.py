Manage Pre-/Post-execution SQL statements with Subscription execution.
Check the ETL flag in the database, run Subscription,
and send an email to the Administrator.

1. Connect to environment using data from workstation
2. Get datasource instance base on provided name ('Tutorial Postgres')
3. Get project object based on provided name ('MicroStrategy Tutorial')
4. Steps below describe the process of managing email subscription for the given
   project and datasource instance
5. Prepare query to select the ETL flag 
6. Execute the query and store the result
7. If the ETL flag is present, get the email subscription object by an id
   and execute it
8. If the ETL flag is missing, send an email to the administrator
9. Steps below describe the process of managing mobile subscription for the given
   project and datasource instance
10. Get the mobile subscription object by an id
11. Execute the mobile subscription and wait for its completion checking the status
12. Prepare SQL query to insert status of the mobile subscription into the table
13. Execute the query
14. Calculate the success rate of the mobile subscription
15. Prepare email content with the results of the mobile subscription's execution
    and send it to the administrator
