    This qualification selects tuples of elements at a specified level by
    comparing the value of a specified metric evaluated at the tuple with
    a value of an expression. The comparison operator used is also specified.
    However, there are multiple options for specifying the expression with which
    the metric is compared:

        - The client may specify a literal value.
        - The client may specify an object reference.
        - The client may ask to use a prompt to determine the value.
        - The client may supply an arbitrary metric style expression to evaluate
          to obtain the value.

    Attributes:
        function: Specify the comparison function that should be used to compare
            the value computed by the filter with an expression value.
        metric: The metric over whose values this qualification is evaluated.
        parameters: List of objects that correspond to the parameters for the
            comparison function.
            In nearly all cases the comparison function will take one extra
            parameter (in addition to the parameter referenced by the
            predicate's main object).
        level_type: Enumeration value indicating how the predicate's level
             should be determined.
             If there is a level it is usually taken to be the same level as is
             used in the display grid, or which was used to obtain the data.
             There is also an option to specify an absolute level as part of the
             predicate definition.
        level: Within an expression we sometimes need to state at which
            a computation is performed.
            In some cases the level is obtained by examining the execution
            environment. This object is used if the designer wishes to specify
            an explicit level. An explicit level is a list of attributes.
            Alternatively the client may defer selecting an attribute
            (or attributes) at design time by using a prompt instead.
            If a prompt is used it should be a choose-attributes prompt, and it
            may return any number of attributes (including zero).
        metric_function: Optional parameter that describes how the metric is
            used within the predicate. If this parameter is omitted it is
            treated as if it had been set to value.
        null_include: NullInclude is an integer parameter which specifies
            how null values are considered when evaluating the Rank function.
            Use 1 to place null values after the value list, use -1 to place
            null values before the value list or use 0 to apply the Null
            checking setting for Analytical Engine in VLDB properties. If this
            value is not set, 0 will be applied.
        break_by: The break by property of a metric qualification allows you to
            choose the attribute level at which to restart counting rank or
            percent values for a metric. This attribute level must be higher
            than or equal to the level of aggregation for the metric itself.
            break_by is a list of distinct attribute references. The list may
            also contain a choose-attribute prompt instead which can be answered
            with zero, one or more attributes. This value is only used when
            the metric_function property is not set to value.
        is_independent: Flag that indicates whether the metric will be evaluated
           independently of other parts of the larger filter:
           - If set to 1 (the default value, also used if this property is
               omitted) then this metric will be evaluated by itself.
           - If set to 0 then other parts of the larger filter will be applied

    qualification predicate. In words this predicate describes a qualification
    of the form "SET of WHERE".

    This node is used within filter expressions to represent a predicate whose
    value is determined by starting with an arbitrary filter expression at some
    natural level. This filter is then projected to a filter at a level
    specified within this predicate by using a relationship. The relationship
    might be the natural relationship inferred by the engine for the schema, the
    relationship given by an explicit table, or a relationship implied by a fact
    (i.e. the engine selects the best table from the set of tables where the
    given fact is implemented).

    This predicate is the only kind of filter predicate that may have a child
    expression.

    Attributes:
        level: Within an expression we sometimes need to state at which a
            computation is performed. In some cases the level is obtained by
            examining the execution environment. This object is used if the
            designer wishes to specify an explicit level.

            An explicit level is a list of attributes. Alternatively the client
            may defer selecting an attribute (or attributes) at design time by
            using a prompt instead. If a prompt is used it should be a
            choose-attributes prompt, and it may return any number of
            attributes (including zero).

        guide: An optional object that specifies how to relate the child filter
            with the output filter. There are three options, depending on the
            nature of the guide object:

            The object may be a logicalTable, in which case the filter is
            projected through this table. The object may be a fact, in which
            case the filter is projected via one of the tables on which the
            fact is defined. There might not be a guide object at all, in which
            case the filter is projected via the engine's usual join rules
            (using attribute relationships from the system hierarchy).

        is_independent: Flag that indicates whether this child filter will be
            considered independently of other parts of the larger filter:

            - If set to 1 (the default value, used if this property is omitted)
            then this filter will be evaluated by itself.

            - If set to 0 then other parts of the larger filter will be merged
            into this filter. Using this setting could change the value of a
            metric or relationship set qualification that appears within the
            child filter.

        children: List containing the optional root node of the child filter
            expression. We require that a relationship predicate always has a
            child filter is always given, but it is possible that the child
            filter is the empty filter. We model that situation by either
            omitting the children value or by using an empty list.

            This expression is also a filter expression, and it is manipulated
            in the same manner as the rest of the filter. The predicate ids
            that appear within this expression must have disjoint values from
            the predicate ids used in the larger filter. Thus, an individual
            node within this expression can be manipulated by treating it as a
            manipulation of the larger filter in the usual manner.

            We use a list so that this value matches the list value of the
            same name used in an operator node.

            be provided. This property is required in the predicate model but
            can be replaced by 'function_prompt' in the expression model.

        function_properties: The list of additional properties associated with

        function_prompt: The prompt used by this function. This field is only
            used in a custom expression tree.

        level_type: Enumeration value indicating how the predicate's level
            should be determined.

            If there is a level it is usually taken to be the same level as is

        level: This field is only used in a custom expression tree.
