"""This is the demo script meant to show how administrator can perform a
migration of objects from one environment to another.

This script will not work without replacing parameters with real values.
Its basic goal is to present what can be done with this module and to
ease its usage.

`mstrio.object_management.migration` module is available as a Functionality Preview.
It is subject to change until it is released as Generally Available.
