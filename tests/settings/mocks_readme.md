# Generating mocks
Mock json files are created via `generate_api_responses.py` script. High level steps are:
 * Download cube response from API   
 * Download report response from API  
 * Download other responses from API  (datasets, api.misc and api.projects)
 * Dump cube response to local drive 
 * Dump report response to local drive
 * Dump other responses to local drive (datasets, api.misc and api.projects)
